# Write a program where the computer randomly generates 
# a positive integer number between 0 and 100. The user 
# needs to guess what the number is. If the user guesses
# wrong three times, tell them their guess is either 
# too large or too small. The user will get the hint only
# after three wrong guesses, and the next hint will not 
# show up until the user makes another three wrong
# guesses. If the user used five hints and still didn't
# guess the correct number, then print out the correct
# number to the user.

# This program is worth 20 points

# You need to "import random" for this program
import random
