# Create a program that will use the "turtle" module to
# visualize the display of every line of the song "99 bottles
# of beer on the wall".
# Instructions
# 1. Your program should use the built-in "turtle" module to
# display 99 bottles on the screen when the program starts
# 2. When the user press the "spacebar" key, your program will
# start to remove one bottle each time and display each line of
# the song on the same screen (which means you cannot use 'print'
# function. Hint: use turtle.write() function)
# 3. The program stops when all bottles on the screen are removed
# and display the following message:
# "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer."
# "Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall"

# RULES
# 1. If you are going to use a list for all the numbers, do NOT
# manually type them all in. Instead, use a built-in function
# 2. Besides the phrase "take one down", you may not type in any
# numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics
# 3. When you reach 1 bottle left,
# the word "bottles" becomes singular

# you need the following "import"
# in order to use the "turtle" module

# Google the internet to find out how to change
# the default image of a turtle object

# This program is worth 40 points
