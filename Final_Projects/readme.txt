You are NOT allowed to use any third-party Python modules to complete your final project(s), such as PyGame,
NumPy, and etc. You must use the built-in modules to complete your project(s). Any usage of third-party
modules will automatically earn you a "0" for your project(s).

Two of the projects are worth 100 points each and the rest is worth either 20 points or 40 points
