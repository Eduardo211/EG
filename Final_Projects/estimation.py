# Write a program to estimate the value of pi and the value of e.
# In Python, the value of pi is calculated using math.pi and the value
# is 3.141592653589793, and the value of e is calculated using math.e
# and the value is 2.718281828459045

# Your program should first asks user to choose what to estimate: pi, e, or quit
# Your program should then asks the user to give a precision of the estimate
# it should be a very small number, such as 0.0001, or 0.00001.
# You can ask the user to manually enter the precision, or give them a list
# so they can choose from.
# Then your program should output the estimated value vs. the  calculated value
# It also shows the total number of estimates it took to get the value
#
# This program is worth 60 points

# The equations for estimating pi and e are in the pi_estimation_equation.jpg and e_estimation_equation.jpg
