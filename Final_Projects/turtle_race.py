# Write a program to use the turtle module to
# create five turtles with different colors who
# will do one "suicide" run to see who is the winner.
# The user hits the "spacebar" to
# start the race.
# The program will indicate which turtle won the race.
# The color of each turtle should be randomly assigned each time
# the program is started
# You will need to "import random" to create random
# speed for each turtle

# Topics covered in this program:
# 1. How to generate numbers
# 2. How to change a turtle's steps
# 3. How to use turtle to write text on the screen
# 4. How to use a while loop to make turtles move
# until all finish the "suicide" run

# This program is worth 40 points
