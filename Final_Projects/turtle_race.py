# Write a program to use the turtle module to
# create five turtles with different colors who
# will race to the finish line with different
# and random speed.
# The user can click on a turtle to bet the
# winning turtle. Then hit the "spacebar" to
# start the race.
# The program will indicate which turtle won the
# race and if the user won their bet.
# You will need to "import random" to create random
# speed for each turtle
