# General steps to calculate the product of a list of numbers:
# 1. Create an accumulator and set its initial value to 1
# Why set it to 1? Why not set it to 0 as we calculate
# the running total of a list of numbers?
# TODO

# 2. Loop through the list of positive numbers, multiply each
# number by the accumulator, then assign the value back
# to the accumulator
# TODO

# 3. Finally, print out the product
