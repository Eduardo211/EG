# You work in a company with a starting salary of $70000
# You are told you will get a 2% merit raise for your salary
# Write a program with a loop that displays the projected salary
# for the next 5 years

# Questions to ask yourself:
# 1. What type of loop do I use? A "while" loop or a "for" loop, why?
# 2. What is the mathematical equation for calculating
# the salary after the 2% raise?
