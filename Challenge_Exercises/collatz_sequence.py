# The Collatz Conjecture is named after Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years
# after receiving his doctorate
# State of the problem
# Considering the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:
# if the number is even, divide it by two
# if the number is odd, triple it and add one
# Now form a sequence by performing this operation repeatedly, beginning with any positive
# integer, and taking the result at each step as the input at the next
# The Collatz conjecture is: This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless
# of which positive integer is chosen initially

# Write a program to prompt user to enter a positive integer
# then print out the Collatz sequence for the positive integer

# Prompt user for the input (don't forget to validate the input)
while True:
    try:
        number = int(input("Please enter a positive integer: "))
        if number <= 0:
            print("The number must be positive. ")
        else:
            break
    except ValueError:
        print("It's not a valid number. ")

# if we reach here, it means the number is valid
print(number, end=' ')
while number != 1:
    if number % 2 == 0: # an even number
        number = number // 2
    else:
        number = number * 3 + 1
    print(number, end=' ')
print()
# What type of loop should we use?

# The sequence should start with the number user chose
# and end with 1
