# The Collatz Conjecture is named after Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years
# after receiving his doctorate
# State of the problem
# Considering the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:
# if the number is even, divide it by two
# if the number is odd, triple it and add one
# Now form a sequence by performing this operation repeatedly, beginning with any positive
# integer, and taking the result at each step as the input at the next
# The Collatz conjecture is: This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless
# of which positive integer is chosen initially

# Write a program to prompt user to enter a positive integer
# then print out the Collatz sequence for the positive integer

# Prompt user for the input (don't forget to validate the input)

# What type of loop should we use?

# The sequence should start with the number user chose
# and end with 1
