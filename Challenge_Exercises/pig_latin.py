# Write a program that will translate an English
# work using the rules of Pig Latin.

# RULES:
# 1. If a word starts with a vowel and ends in a vowel, add "yay" to
# the end (olive -> oliveyay)
# 2. If a word starts with a vowel and ends in a consonant, add "ay"
# to the end (elephant -> elephantay)
# 3. If a word has no vowels, add "ay" to the end (tsk -> tskay)
# 4. If a word has a vowel and starts with a consonant, move all
# the letters before the initial vowel to the end, then
# add "ay" to the end (pig -> igpay, fellow -> ellowfay)

# Your code will ask user to enter an English word
# then print out the translated Pig Latin word

# TODO prompt the user to enter a word

# TODO translate it using the rules of Pig Latin

# TODO print out the translated word
